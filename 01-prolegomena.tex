\section{Gradient-based optimization}

\section{Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning}
ERL is RL with evolutionary methods

The ERL field lacks a comparison / benchmarking tool, which is why we did the DOTA 2 competition and we are working on BERL

\section{Development tools}
\subsection{Julia}
Julia is a high-level, dynamic programming language designed for high-performance with a just-in-time compiler. It is notably interoperable with multiple languages, including C, Fortran, Python, R, MATLAB, Java, or Scala

Test-Driven Development: translate requirements into tests, then develop until tests pass.

We used Julia in this project to provide a faster environment than Python, while still being compatible with state-of-the-art Python libraries.

\subsection{Cambrian}
\href{https://github.com/d9w/Cambrian.jl}{\color{blue}{Cambrian.jl}} is an Evolutionary Computation framework developed in Julia by my supervisor Dennis Wilson. It implements a structure to facilitate the development of evolutionary algorithms, focusing on genetic programming and neuroevolution. 

I used Cambrian in to provide a consistent framework between projects and ensure compatibility, and for its usefulness in structuring the development.
