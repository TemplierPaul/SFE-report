This internship has given me the opportunity to learn more about the field of Evolutionary Computation, which I had been attracted toward for many years. I got to discover both the quality and the diversity of the work on this topic, and more generally on Artificial Life, through reading bibliography and attending conferences. 

Neuroevolution methods have opened to me a different approach to Reinforcement Learning and its questions, building new techniques on algorithmic ideas discovered decades ago and based on natural behaviors evolved for thousands of years. The SuReLI team has also been a great inspiration source, joining multiple approaches and competences in the same goal of improving RL research, in a skilled and enjoyable working environment. 

I have thoroughly enjoyed working on this project, and I look forward to keeping working with Dennis Wilson and Emmanuel Rachelson in the next years, since I am set to continue this internship with a PhD\footnote{Co-financed by the Occitanie Region and ISAE-SUPAERO, pending paperwork completion} on bio-inspired methods for Artificial Neural Network learning. With both of them as supervisor, we will tackle the issue of finding policies that help networks actually learn instead of solely optimize for a specific task, based on biological neuronal models and notably building on previous work in Neuromodulation \cite{neuromodulation}.
